Exercise 01 : ft_print_params
We’re dealing with a program here, you should therefore have a function main in

test1
test2
test3
$>

Exercise 02 : ft_rev_params
We’re dealing with a program here, you should therefore have a function main in
your .c file. Create a program that displays its given arguments.
One per line, in the reverse order of the command line. It should display all arguments, except for argv[0].
Allowed functions: write

Exercise 03 : ft_sort_params
We’re dealing with a program here, you should therefore have a function main in
