Exercice 00 : ft_putchar
Write a function that displays the character passed as a parameter.
Allowed functions: write

Exercise 01 : ft_print_alphabet
Create a function that displays the alphabet in lowercase, on a single line, by
ascending order, starting from the letter ’a’.
Allowed functions: write

Exercise 02 : ft_print_reverse_alphabet
Create a function that displays the alphabet in lowercase, on a single line, by
descending order, starting from the letter ’z’
Allowed functions: write

Exercise 03 : ft_print_numbers
Create a function that displays all digits, on a single line, by ascending order.
Allowed functions: write

Exercise 04 : ft_is_negative
Create a function that displays ’N’ or ’P’ depending on the integer’s sign entered as a parameter. 
If n is negative, display ’N’. If n is positive or null, display ’P’.
Allowed functions: write

Exercise 05 : ft_print_comb
Create a function that displays all different combinations of three different digits in
ascending order, listed by ascending order - yes, repetition is voluntary.
987 isn’t there because 789 already is.
999 isn’t there because the digit 9 is present more than once.
Here’s the intended output :
$>./a.out | cat -e
012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017, 018, 019, 023, ..., 789$>
Allowed functions: write

Exercise 06 : ft_print_comb2
Create a function that displays all different combination of two digits between 00
and 99, listed by ascending order.
Here’s the intended output :
$>./a.out | cat -e
00 01, 00 02, 00 03, 00 04, 00 05, ..., 00 99, 01 02, ..., 97 99, 98 99$>
Allowed functions: write

Exercise 07 : ft_putnbr
Create a function that displays the number entered as a parameter. The function
has to be able to display all possible values within an int type variable.
Allowed functions: write

Exercise 08 : ft_print_combn
Create a function that displays all different combinations of n numbers by ascending
order.
n will be so that : 0 < n < 10.
If n = 2, here’s the expected output :
$>./a.out | cat -e
01, 02, 03, ..., 09, 12, ..., 79, 89$>
Allowed functions: write
