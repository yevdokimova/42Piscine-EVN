42 Piscine - November 2020

Here are presented the problems/exercises I've submitted for Piscine 42. Piscine is a part of the selection process for 42 Internation coding schools. Every exercise is correct and has been approved by the Moulinette.  Copy/Pasting exercises without understanding are bad, for you and for the wellness of the Piscine. Luckily, I have passed the Piscine and have been accepted at 42Yerevan.
