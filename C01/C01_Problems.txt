as parameters.

Exercise 03 : ft_div_mod
This function divides parameters a by b and stores the result in the int pointed by
div. It also stores the remainder of the division of a by b in the int pointed by mod.

Exercise 04 : ft_ultimate_div_mod
This function divides parameters a by b. The result of this division is stored in the
int pointed by a. The remainder of the division is stored in the int pointed by b.
