Files to turn in: main.c, ft_puthar.c, rush04.c
Allowed functions: write
Remarks: n/a

Example of main.c:
int		main()
{
	rush(5, 5);
	return ();
}

You must therefore create the function rush taking two variables of type in as arguments, 
named respectively x and y. Your function rush should display (on-screen) a rectangle of x characters for width,
and y characters for length. Your main will be modified during defense, to check if you've handled everything
you're supposed to.

rush(5, 3) should display:
$>./a.out
ABBBC
B   B
CBBBA
$>

rush(5, 1) should display:
$>./a.out
ABBBC
$>

rush(1, 1) should display:
$>./a.out
A
$>

rush(1, 5) should display:
$>./a.out
A
B

C

rush(4, 4) should display:
$>./a.out
ABBC
B  B
